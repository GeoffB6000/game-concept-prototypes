Concept: Your wife has taken up her ancestral sword and goes out every day to slay the monsters beseiging the kingdom. You want to support her, so you make sure she eats right and has good armour and equipment and knows that she is loved. This is a Support RPG about love!

## Game Loop
You have a certain amount of money. During the day, you buy food and gifts for your wife, you do housework, you make her a lovely and filling dinner. You have to choose what tasks to prioritize, what to buy, to ensure your wife's success. If she's tired, if she's hungry, if she's cold, if she's lonely, her battles will just get harder and harder. Your task is to be her anchor, her home.
### Hub
You live in a small house in an unremarkable village. You don't have a lot of money. Each morning after your wife sets out to fight the next horrifying beast you have a choice as to how to spend your day.
- Clean up the house
- Go shopping
- Pursue hobbies
- Talk to your neighbours

The day has three stages: Morning, Afternoon, and Evening. After you take your Evening action (ideally cooking dinner), your wife comes home and tells you about the beast she slew that day, drops off whatever spoils or treasures she's claimed, and you have the opportunity to talk.
