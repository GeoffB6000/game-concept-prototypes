# Project "Anthropocene"
#### concept by Geoffrey Bates

## Overview
This project aims to represent in game form some key themes in the field of Digital Humanities as understood by Carleton University's DH5000 class of 2018/2019. Our objective is to introduce the main concerns of Digital Humanities to those who have so far had minimal engagement with the term, in a way that is both instructive and entertaining, in order to promote understanding and curiosity of some of the fundamental concerns of our time. At the time of this writing, group consensus is pointing towards a card game taking inspiration from Kate Compton's [Generominos](http://www.galaxykate.com/generominos/). The principal act is the creative combination of DH tools and other technologies directed towards solving social, environmental, and scientific problems. The goal of this file is to describe a conceptual and narrative framework into which we can insert our developing mechanics.

## Ludonarrative Design
My starting point is the idea that in order for this game to send a clear message and command engagement, certain exaggerations must be made. The objective therefore is to create an exciting game world with narrative possibilities that invite play. Here are the underpinnings of this first stab at design:
1. Displacement. By setting the game in the future, we can take all of our present anxieties of ecological collapse and social friction and advance them to the point of crisis (as if they are not already at the point of crisis!). We represent a broken world and put the tools to fix it in the hands of the players, introducing inherent motivators and narrative tensions. As inventors and visionaries in a chaotic world, players hold the future in their hands. A future setting also allows us to think broadly as to the uses and functions of the technologies forming our game's main objects of play (so instead of "Twitter Bot," we might combine concepts of "Social Media" and "Machine Learning," or "Social Media" and "Text-manipulating Algorithm").
2. Mythology. DH naturally deals with big questions, vast networks of interrelated technologies, labour and government practices, political and economic power, the interconnectedness of society and the planet itself. In order to gameify this way of thinking, I am tempted to clump these concepts around figures who can be quickly known and understood. So within the world of the game, we will have a clear container for the swirl of ideas encompassing environment, labour, technology, and control exemplified by movements such as [minimal computing](https://go-dh.github.io/mincomp/thoughts/2016/10/02/minimal-definitions/). In other words, we create and manipulate archetypes of the Anthropocene, allowing our players to personally connect and craft stories of human agency in a world shaped by human agency writ large.
3. Choice. In correspondence with the above two points, this game should offer players meaningful options in how they craft their engagement with the game world. So we may have competing archetypes, multiple visions of the future to build towards. We may also offer players the option to pursue their own path, to create without restraint or care for consequences as they so choose.

## Project "Anthropocene"
The year is 2525. The surviving life of Earth is adapting to the omnipresence of plastic throughout the biosphere. Seas have boiled away. Storms are constant, global, and poisonous. Nations have broken and re-formed under movements of people, and many have come to realize that survival demands sacrifice, a re-thinking of established ways, new ideas and connections. **THE AEON**, mysterious shepherd of humanity's future, has called upon you, **THE MAKER**, to create a proposal for a new technology to address one aspect of the world's damage. You accomplish this by drawing on a vast living archive of humanity's past technologies from which you synthesize something specific and new. But there are other Makers given the same task, and the AEON will only realize one of these proposals. Whoever can get the job done, while best exemplifying the AEON's ideals of universal compassion and justice, will be honoured in the world to come. Meanwhile, other organizations are proposing alternate futures. **OLYMPUS** is attempting to mobilize the human race to answer an extraterrestrial broadcast orginating in the orbit of Jupiter. Will you build towards a healthy Earth, or pursue humanity's destiny in space? Or will you walk your own path, and see how your creations fare in the chaotic marketplace of ideas?
### Narrative Components
- **THE MAKER**. The player persona, a revolutionary scientist/artist/scholar tasked with inventing the methods of the future.
- **THE LIBRARY**. Ultimate source of the Maker's knowledge and technologies, the raw materials of the future.
- **THE AEON**. An organization, a goddess, a revolutionary thinker, a collective, an artificial intelligence? Their goal is the cultivation of a society that prioritizes the health of planet Earth, social equity and justice, compassion and love across all boundaries, for millennia to come. Their supporters include artists and scientists of all disciplines.
- **OLYMPUS**. A movement calling for widespread support of spaceflight technologies. Their ultimate goal is to reach Jupiter and contact The Alien, though they are divided as to how to do this. OLYMPUS is supported by all sorts, from rational scientists to radical Stargazers who tune their radios to the Jovian Frequency as a way to spiritually connect to outer space.
- **THE RED MARKET**. Operating on a philosophy of CRISIS CAPITALISM, the traders of the globally-connected "Red Market" believe that everything has a use. Their speculators will back any project that has a chance of gaining traction in one of the world's many hungry markets, including proposals which failed to impress The AEON or OLYMPUS. But their support is fickle, and they are willing to risk the health of the planet and its people in the pursuit of wealth.
### Possible Game Components
- **TECH DECK**. This deck of cards represents the technologies of the Library. Makers draw on this for inspiration, and assemble their proposals using these components.
- **PROJECT DECKS**. There will be one of these for the AEON and one for OLYMPUS. Cards in this deck outline the organization's parameters for a given project. Example: *MAKER, OLYMPUS calls upon you to develop a program to be uploaded to the archaic JUNO SPACECRAFT with the purpose of establishing communication with THE JUPITER ENTITY. The program will require maximal intelligence and minimal computing power.* Or, *MAKER, THE AEON calls upon you to train disadvantaged youth in the VANCOUVER-2 CONURBATION in the use and maintenance of information technologies. Your proposal must make use of locally-available materials and adhere to the 2104 REVISED HUMAN RIGHTS CODE.*
- **CRISIS DECK**. These cards describe situations arising from the tumultuous state of the world which impose limitations on your creative process. Example: *QUARANTINE. Your country has sealed all international trade and travel in response to a global pandemic. From this point forward, your proposal cannot involve NON-LOCAL RESOURCES.*
